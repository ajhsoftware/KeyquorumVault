1. License Grant

We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the Keyquorum Vault application (“Application”) for your personal or internal business purposes in accordance with this EULA.

2. Ownership

The Application (excluding third-party open-source components listed in the licenses/ folder) is licensed, not sold, and remains our property.

3. Restrictions

Except as expressly permitted by this EULA or by applicable law, you will not copy, publish, sublicense, rent, lease, or distribute the Application, or modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble any proprietary part of it.
This Section does not limit any rights you have under third-party open-source licenses or rights that cannot be restricted by law.
To the extent required for such licenses (e.g., LGPL), reverse-engineering for debugging modified components is permitted.

4. Third-Party Open-Source Components

The Application includes third-party components under their own licenses. Full texts are included in the Application at: licenses/SPDX_LICENSES/ and licenses/SPDX_LICENSES/vendors/.
Notices appear in licenses/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt.
In particular, the Application uses PySide6 (Qt for Python) under LGPL-3.0-only. You may replace LGPL libraries with compatible versions.

5. Security and Data Responsibility

You are solely responsible for safeguarding your master password, recovery keys, 2FA tokens, backup codes, and exports.
We cannot access or recover your vault if you lose these credentials. You should maintain secure, offline backups appropriate to your risk tolerance.

6. No Warranty

THE APPLICATION IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.
YOUR USE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain warranties; where so, these disclaimers apply only to the maximum extent permitted by law.

7. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; LOSS OF PROFITS; LOSS OF DATA; SECURITY BREACHES; UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS; OR COSTS OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE APPLICATION OR THIS EULA.
OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO THE AUTHORIZED PLATFORM FOR THE APPLICATION IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.
Nothing in this EULA limits liability for fraud or for death or personal injury resulting from negligence where prohibited by law.

8. Consumers — Statutory Rights (UK/EU)

If you are a consumer, nothing in this EULA affects your statutory rights. For paid digital content supplied by download, you may have a 14-day right to cancel under applicable law; if you request immediate supply and we (or our platform partner) begin the download, you may lose that right. Refunds, if any, are handled under platform policies and applicable law.

9. Purchases, Refunds & Cancellations

(a) Microsoft Store. If you purchase through the Microsoft Store, Microsoft is the merchant of record and handles all billing, taxes, and refunds under the Microsoft Terms of Sale and applicable law. Refund requests must be made via your Microsoft account.

(b) Lemon Squeezy or Other Authorized Resellers. If you purchase a license or subscription through Lemon Squeezy (or another authorized reseller), that platform is the merchant of record and manages all payments, invoicing, tax collection, and refunds according to its own Terms of Service and applicable law. AJH Software does not directly process any payments or refunds.

(c) Direct Sales. If you obtain the Application directly from us (e.g., custom enterprise or bulk license agreement), the Consumer Contracts Regulations (UK) and/or EU consumer rules may grant a 14-day cooling-off period for change of mind. By requesting immediate download or activation, you acknowledge that this right is waived once download or installation begins. Faulty or non-conforming software remains subject to repair, replacement, or refund as required by law.

(d) Subscriptions or Paid Add-ons. If any subscription features are offered, renewals and cancellations are handled through the respective sales platform (Microsoft Store or Lemon Squeezy) under its terms.

10. Updates

We may release updates or changes to the Application from time to time. Updates may include additional or modified terms.

11. Termination

This EULA terminates automatically if you materially breach it. Upon termination you must cease all use and destroy all copies of the Application. Sections 2 and 6–13 survive termination.

12. Export & Compliance

You represent that you are not in a jurisdiction where use of the Application is prohibited and that you will comply with all applicable laws relating to its use.

13. Governing Law & Jurisdiction

This EULA and any dispute arising out of it are governed by the laws of England and Wales. The courts of England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction, except that either party may seek injunctive relief in any competent court.

14. Entire Agreement

This EULA is the entire agreement concerning the proprietary parts of the Application (excluding third-party open-source licenses). If any provision is unenforceable, it will be applied to the maximum extent permitted, and the remainder will continue in effect.
