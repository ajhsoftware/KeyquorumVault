Copyright © 2025 Anthony Hatton (trading as “AJH Software”). All rights reserved.

IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. BY INSTALLING OR USING THE APPLICATION,
YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE IT.

0. Licensor
“Licensor”, “we”, “us” means Anthony Hatton, trading as “AJH Software”. You may contact us at
the support link shown in the Application (or support@ajhsoftware.uk).

1. License Grant
We license you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the
Keyquorum Vault application (“Application”) for your personal or internal business purposes.

2. Ownership
The Application (excluding third‑party open‑source components listed in the licenses/ folder)
is licensed, not sold, and remains our property.

3. Restrictions
Except as expressly permitted by this EULA or by applicable law, you will not copy, publish,
sublicense, rent, lease, or distribute the Application, or modify, reverse‑engineer, decompile,
or disassemble any proprietary part of it. This Section does not limit any rights you have under
third‑party open‑source licenses used by the Application or rights you have that cannot be
limited by law. To the extent required to exercise rights under such licenses (e.g., the LGPL),
reverse engineering for purposes of debugging such modifications is permitted.

4. Third‑Party Open‑Source Components (LGPL, etc.)
The Application includes third‑party components under their own licenses. Full texts are bundled
in the Application at: licenses/SPDX_LICENSES/ and originals under licenses/SPDX_LICENSES/vendors/.
Notices appear in licenses/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt. In particular, the Application uses PySide6
(Qt for Python) under LGPL‑3.0‑only. You may replace the LGPL libraries with compatible versions.
Nothing in this EULA is intended to limit rights you have under those third‑party licenses.

5. Security, Keys, and Data Responsibility
You are solely responsible for safeguarding your master password, recovery keys, 2FA tokens,
backup codes, and any exports. We cannot access or recover your vault if you lose the
necessary credentials. You should maintain secure, offline backups appropriate to your risk tolerance.

6. No Warranty
THE APPLICATION IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. YOUR USE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.
Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain warranties; to the extent such laws apply,
these disclaimers will apply only to the maximum extent permitted.

7. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; LOSS OF PROFITS; LOSS OF DATA; SECURITY
BREACHES; UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS; OR COSTS OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THE APPLICATION OR THIS EULA, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY
FOR ALL CLAIMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR THE APPLICATION IN THE 12 MONTHS
PRECEDING THE CLAIM. Nothing in this EULA limits or excludes liability for fraud or for death or
personal injury resulting from negligence, to the extent such limitation is prohibited by law.

8. Consumers — Statutory Rights (UK/EU)
If you are a consumer, nothing in this EULA affects your statutory rights. For paid digital
content supplied by download, you may have a 14‑day right to cancel under applicable law; if you
request/consent to immediate supply and we begin the download, you may lose that right. Refunds,
if any, will be handled in accordance with applicable law and our store policy.

9. Updates
We may make updates or changes to the Application from time to time. Updates may be subject to
additional terms.

10. Termination
This EULA terminates automatically if you materially breach it. Upon termination you must cease
all use of the Application and destroy all copies in your possession or control. Sections 2 and 6–12
survive termination.

11. Export/Compliance
You represent that you are not located in any jurisdiction where use of the Application is prohibited
and that you will comply with applicable laws relating to your use of the Application.

12. Governing Law; Venue
This EULA and any dispute arising out of it are governed by the laws of England and Wales, without
regard to conflict of laws rules. The courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction;
however, either party may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.

13. Entire Agreement
This EULA is the entire agreement regarding the proprietary parts of the Application (exclusive of
third‑party open‑source licenses). If any provision is held unenforceable, it will be enforced to
the maximum extent permitted, and the remainder will continue in full force and effect.
